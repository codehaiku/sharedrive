<h3><strong>Sharedrive - Private WordPress Site Option</strong></h3>

Sharedrive is a small plugin for WordPress that allows you to hide the content of your website to non-logged in visitors and only displays them to logged in users.

This plugin redirects the users to the provided login page with a login form that allows them to type their username/email and password combination. 

It validates the users’ credentials and displays a set of configurable messages if there are errors such as invalid username, empty username, wrong password, and etcetera.

The plugin has settings inside the Administration Panel (‘Settings’ > 'Sharedrive') that allows you to configure where you want the user to be taken after he/she has successfully logged in, this can be a page, a custom URL, or just the default behavior.

<strong>Current Version: 2.0.3</strong>

<h3><strong>Caveats</strong></h3>

Sharedrive is only built for WordPress website owners to redirect non-logged in users to a custom login form. This plugin is not a replacement for Membership websites where a complex set of configurations are allowed. There are no payments model, subscriptions, and role types.

Sharedrive is good for Private Intranet Websites where membership is required.
